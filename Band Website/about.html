          Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. It
          currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm
          guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt
          Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar.
          Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer
          Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they
          were still in high school.

          After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging?, the band
          signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in
          1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label
          dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band
          re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding
          guitarist Valentine. The band signed with Octone Records, an independent
          record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records
          and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by
          the singles "Harder to Breathe", "This Love" and "She Will Be Loved",
          the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart and went
          quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy
          Award for Best New Artist. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering
          from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.

            The band's second album It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in May
            2007. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the
            lead single "Makes Me Wonder", became the band's first number-one single
            on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, the band released the third album
            Hands All Over, to mixed reviews, re-releasing a year later to include
            the single "Moves like Jagger", which topped the Billboard Hot 100. In
            2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton,
            as the band released the fourth album Overexposed, with the song "One
            More Night", topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive
            weeks. In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record
            the fifth album V (pronounced "five"), with the band signed to
            Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the
            release of V, it reached number one on the Billboard 200. In 2016,
            Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band
            continued for the sixth studio album Red Pill Blues, which was released
            in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band's
            lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums
            "Sugar" and "Girls Like You" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot
            100 chart respectively. Maroon 5 has sold more than 120 million records,
            making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.

            Maroon 5's musical style has generally been regarded as pop, pop rock,
            funk rock, dance-pop, blue-eyed soul, neo soul, R&B and soft rock. Adam
            Levine has stated: "Everything that's written and performed and put
            together pretty much comes from us. I just think people would be
            surprised to know that we're a self-contained unit. We're a band that
            does their own thing. There's no puppet master." However, in an article
            about the songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed that at
            least some of the band's songs, such as "Moves like Jagger," are the
            product of efforts by or collaborations with, professional songwriters
            and producers. In the same article, Levine says, "It's almost as if
            [Benny Blanco] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together
            at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about collaboration.
            And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best."

            Adam Levine cited Britpop band Oasis as "one of the best bands ever" and
            said "We love Oasis". The band has cited Michael Jackson, The
            Beatles, The Police, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, the Bee Gees,
            Tonic, Prince, Tupac Shakur and Marvin Gaye as
            influences. Levine has also cited Billy Joel as an
            influence. Furthermore, guitarist James Valentine said he was
            influenced by guitarists like Pat Metheny, Bill Frisell and John
            Scofield, as well as the rock band Queens of the Stone Age. The
            band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or
            synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost
            love; songs like "This Love", "Makes Me Wonder" and "Misery" have a very
            cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship,
            while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as "She Will Be
            Loved" and "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" express a longing for a romantic
            relationship. "Makes Me Wonder" has a secondary theme, in which Levine
            expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American
            politics and the Iraq War.
